*How to run AVL or BST test operations with g++: (testing.cpp)

note: must use --std=c++11 for dependency purposes

    g++ --std=c++11 -Wall -g bst.h avlbst.h testing.cpp -o testing

Have fun playing around with the insertions, removals, print, find, etc..

Backtracking part was done in a rush so it doesn't work.
Will also probably have way more time complexity than it should.
